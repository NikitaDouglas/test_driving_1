Brief:

As a student
So that I can understand my recent motivation
I want an IRB application that stores my motivation ratings
And I want to see the average of my last 3 ratings

> motivation(5)
=> "Motivation stored!"
> show_motivation
=> [5]
> average_motivation
=> "Not enough motivations to average!"
> motivation(6)
=> "Motivation stored!"
> motivation(5)
=> "Motivation stored!"
> show_motivation
=> [5, 6, 5]
> average_motivation
=> 5.1
> motivation(6)
=> "Motivation stored!"
> average_motivation
=> 5.2
